SKTP Client for Commodore 64 in 6502 Assembler for WiC64

This assembler program for the C64 depends on a network device available to the Commodore 64. Currently, it depends on a WiC64 connected to the userport of the C64. Without real hardware this setup can be emulated by using a C64 emulator software that supports WiC64 emulation like Kernal64 oder Vice (at this time a current development snapshot is necessary).

This SKTP client allows the C64 to communicate with an "SKTP server" in the same way as the Sidekick64 network kernel does.

I have started my work on this assembler program by extending the "WiC64 Test PHP Directory Example" written by Sven Oliver "KiWi" Arke available from here https://www.wic64.de/downloads/. The routines to communicate with the WiC64 via the userport is probably the only unchanged code that is still the same as in the example.
